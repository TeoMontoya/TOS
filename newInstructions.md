## Side comment on css and justify content
when it comes to css, there is no such thing as "align-content" or "justify-self"
when it comes to primary axis, we are moving the whole group altogether. 
meanwhile, on the cross axis, we can move items individually or as a group, as they have a lot of space to themselves in that axis.
