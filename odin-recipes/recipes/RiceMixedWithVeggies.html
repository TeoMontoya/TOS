            <h3>Preparation</h3>

            1. Cook the rice according to the package instructions. Set aside.

            2. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. In a large skillet or pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter
            over medium heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook until they are browned on both sides and cooked through,
            about 6-8 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.

            3. In the same skillet, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the diced white onions and chopped
            green onions, and saut√© until they become tender and translucent, about 3-4 minutes.

            4. Add the mixed vegetables to the skillet and cook until they are heated through. If you are using frozen
            vegetables, make sure to thaw them first.

            5. While the vegetables are cooking, shred the cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces.

            6. Once the vegetables are heated through, add the cooked rice and shredded chicken to the skillet. Mix
            everything together until well combined.

            7. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the rice mixture. Cover the skillet with a lid and cook on
            low heat for a few minutes, until the cheese has melted and becomes gooey.

            8. Remove from heat and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with additional chopped green
            onions if desired.
