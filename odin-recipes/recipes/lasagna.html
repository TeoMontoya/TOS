            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            To make the lasagna, follow these steps:

            1. Cook the noodles according to package directions; drain and set aside.
            2. In a large skillet, cook the sausage, beef, onion and garlic over medium heat until browned; drain the
            fat.
            3. Stir in the tomatoes, tomato paste, water, sugar, parsley, Italian seasoning, basil, fennel, salt and
            pepper; bring to a boil then reduce the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
            4. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and ricotta cheese; set aside.
            5. Preheat oven to 375Â°F and lightly grease a 13x9-inch baking dish.
            6. Spread 2 cups of the meat sauce evenly over the bottom of the prepared dish.
            7. Arrange 3 noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them.
            8. Spread a third of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.
            9. Sprinkle with a cup of mozzarella cheese and a quarter cup of Parmesan cheese.
            10. Repeat the layers twice more, ending with the remaining meat sauce and cheeses on top.
            11. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes.
            12. Uncover and bake for another 25 minutes or until bubbly and golden.
            13. Let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes before slicing and serving.
